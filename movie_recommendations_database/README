Project 5

1. How you have incorporated the lab 7 code into project 4. 
Specifically, how you have generated the input to lab 7 code 
and how you used the output from lab 7 code to generate movie recommendations.

I used part of lab 7's code to find the similar users of the main user. 
For the input with part of lab 7's code, I put in an rating 2d array of 
all ratings from all users. Then, it will return to me the index of the similar 
users of main user. Then, with the output, I used it to recommend the main user 
movies that his/her similar users have watched and have rated it with good ratings
and main user haven't watched. 

2. How your program works. 
Specifically, how the movie recommendations change when user adds new ratings.

Movies recommendations changes if the similar users have changes. 
When it adds new ratings, it might change the result of similar user, therefore, changing what 
movies would be printed out.
